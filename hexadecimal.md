### Hexadecimal

Hexidecimal numbers are another type of number often used in computer science. We now know that binary numbers are a base-2 number system. However, other systems are used by computers. A system frequently used by many computers in addition to binary is the hexadecimal system. This is a base-16 system, which uses capital letters to represent 10-15. The letters A, B, C, D, E, and F are used to represent 10-15. Here's how to count from 8 to 18 in hexadecimal, with their decimal counterparts in parentheses: 

...
8 (8)
9 (9)
A (10)
B (11)
C (12)
D (13)
E (14)
F (15)
10 (16)
11 (17)
12 (18)
...

Computers often use hexadecimal in conjunction with binary. You can learn more about how these systems are interlinked in other INFOTC classes.
